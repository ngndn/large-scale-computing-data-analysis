# Large Scale Computing Data Analysis
A project-based course @ Aalto University

# Topic: Human-in-the-loop for connecting ML pipelines and workflow-based data analysis in large-scale computing

## 0 Preliminary Plan
1. A literature review on current status of human-in-the-loop in ML pipelines and workflow-based data analysis
   * Can potentially reference other fields if there are not much information.
3. Based on the literature review, identify one area to investigate further
4. Identify potential improvement(s) in that area.
5. Suggest and develop the concepts for the improvements (a proof of concept as a software may not fit in the scope of this course).
6. Write and present results.
